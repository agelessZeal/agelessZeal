# DEX and NFT expert. 
âš¡ 

### I am a big crypto specialist. I have rich experience in defi/dapp fields. I have completed several projects like swapping tokens in ethereum blockchain, sushi-based DEX on binance smart chain. I can support a robust analytical approach to problem-solving, which yields practical and effective solutions.

### As a full-stack engineer, I can take ownership of your entire project, from implementing pixel perfect front-end user interfaces to the continuous deployments to the cloud. 

### I believe smooth communication between a client and a developer is the key to success when it comes to any projects.
