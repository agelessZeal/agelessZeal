## GameFi Engineer âš¡

### I am a big crypto specialist. I have rich experience in defi/gamefi/nft fields. I have completed several projects like DEX, NFT Game on evm chain and nft marketplace. I can support a robust analytical approach to problem-solving, which yields practical and effective solutions.

### As a full-stack engineer, I can take ownership of your entire project, from implementing pixel perfect front-end user interfaces to the continuous deployments to the cloud. 

### I believe smooth communication between a client and a developer is the key to success when it comes to any projects.
